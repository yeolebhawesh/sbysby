    <h1> 12 Signs of Zodiac </h1>
    <p>The zodiac is a belt-shaped region of the sky that extends approximately 8° north or south (as measured in
        celestial latitude) of the ecliptic, the apparent path of the Sun across the celestial sphere over the course of
        the year. The paths of the Moon and visible planets are within the belt of the zodiac.

        In Western astrology, and formerly astronomy, the zodiac is divided into twelve signs, each occupying 30° of
        celestial longitude and roughly corresponding to the star constellations: Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo,
        Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces.[2][3]

        These astrological signs form a celestial coordinate system, or more specifically an ecliptic coordinate system,
        which takes the ecliptic as the origin of latitude and the Sun's position at vernal equinox as the origin of
        longitude.</p>
